## Project Setup
Perform the following steps in order to edit and run the source code:
1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Install Homebrew. This is necessary to easily install other prerequisites. See instructions at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).
3. Install `git`. This is necessary to push and pull code to and from GitHub. You can install this using Homebrew by running `brew install git` in the Terminal. Or, if you are not familiar with `git`, you can install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to help learn, and it comes with `git` included.
4. Install `pipenv`. This is necessary to get the right version of Python and all the libraries setup to run the code. You can install this using Homebrew by running `brew install pipenv` in the Terminal.
5. Install an IDE. This is necessary to edit the source code files. You can use whichever IDE you want, but [PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) is a great choice.
6. Clone the `loeppky-games` GitHub repository. This is necessary to download the repository source code. The repository URL is `https://github.com/MixMasterMitch/loeppky-games.git` TODO
